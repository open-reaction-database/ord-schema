Schema for the Open Reaction Database initiative, based in part on survey of importance ([summary](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1waPzYvDKlb6TAwgsM7bLc7dhZnJ8G-WtVxJSlMhiVK0/edit)). For more details, please see the documentation at http://open-reaction-database.org.

We are currently in the process of formalizing the schema and creating examples for both low-level and high-level use. Consider joining the [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!members/open-reaction-database) to stay up to date with announcements and opportunities for providing feedback.
