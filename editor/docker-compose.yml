# docker-compose configuration for the ORD editor + postgres backend database.
#
# Two environment variables are required:
#   * ORD_EDITOR_POSTGRES_PASSWORD: The postgres password.
#   * ORD_EDITOR_MOUNT: Mount location for the volume on which the database
#     is stored. This is designed for use with GCP, where the mount location
#     refers to a persistent disk that will not disappear when the image is
#     restarted. See https://github.com/docker-library/docs/blob/master/postgres/README.md#pgdata
#     for more details. When running locally, this should be set to something
#     like "${HOME}/ord-editor-data".
