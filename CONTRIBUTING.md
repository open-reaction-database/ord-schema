## Make a change

Excellent! There are a few steps you'll need to follow to get ready to submit changes for review:

1. Make sure your changes are consistent with the [goals](https://ord-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#goals)
   and [non-goals](https://ord-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#non-goals) of the database. If your changes
   address a long-term need we may ask that it be deferred until sometime in the future. In particular, please avoid
   changes that significantly increase the complexity of creating or using the data.
1. Make your changes in a [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks)
   of the `ord-schema` repository. You can work on GitHub or on your local machine:
   
   ### GitHub
   
   1. Create a fork of `ord-schema` by clicking the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page. 
      Note that you only need to do this once---all of your changes can use the same fork.
   1. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/github-flow)
      to make changes and send a pull request to the `dev` branch of the official repository. While you are making 
      changes, automated tests will run in your fork after each commit and notify you of any errors encountered in
      validation or syntax.
   
   ### Local machine
   
   > :warning: Working on your local machine requires familiarity with
   > [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

   1. Create a fork of `ord-schema` (click "Fork" at the top-right of this page) and clone it to your local machine 
      ([instructions](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)).
   1. Create a new branch and make your changes.
   1. Test your changes by rebuilding the package (`python setup.py install`) and running the test script provided
      in the repo (`./run_tests.sh`). This will be performed automatically when you send a pull request to the
      repository, but you can save time by making sure the tests pass locally first.
   1. Commit your changes, push them to your fork on GitHub, and send a pull request to the `dev` branch of the
      official repository.
      
1. If necessary, update your pull request by adding additional commits to your branch in response to
   reviewer comments and automated tests. Once the reviewers have approved your changes, they will merge
   them into the official repository.
