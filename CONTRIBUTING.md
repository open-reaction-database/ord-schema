## Make a change

Excellent! There are a few steps you'll need to follow to get ready to submit changes for review:

1. Make sure your changes are consistent with the [goals](https://ord-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#goals)
   and [non-goals](https://ord-schema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview.html#non-goals) of the database. If your changes
   address a long-term need we may ask that it be deferred until sometime in the future. In particular, please avoid
   changes that significantly increase the complexity of creating or using the data.
1. Make your changes in a [fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-forks)
   of the `ord-schema` repository. You can work on GitHub or on your local machine:
   
   ### GitHub
   
   1. Create a fork of `ord-schema` by clicking the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page. 
      Note that you only need to do this once---all of your changes can use the same fork.
   1. Follow the [GitHub flow](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/github-flow)
      to make changes and send a pull request to the official repository.
   
   ### Local machine
   
   > :warning: Working on your local machine requires familiarity with
   > [Git](https://git-scm.com/) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/).

      official repository.

   them into the official repository.
