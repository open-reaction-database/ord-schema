# Overview

The Open Reaction Database (ORD) initiative aims to build a publicly available
collection of chemical reaction data "to support machine learning and related
efforts in reaction prediction, chemical synthesis planning, and experiment
design" (see the [MVP document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xh24AnDp1nKlN87Nsh2986VTnN5OeSEE9XS5TcV9DGE/edit#)).
By providing a place to store these data and a structured data format ("schema")
for representing chemical reactions, the ORD will enable cross-institutional
collaboration and data reproducibility on a worldwide scale.

We expect that this database will be the starting point for the development of
best-in-class tools and models for reaction prediction and synthesis planning.
Additionally, we hope it will serve as a basis for experimental efforts in
industry and academia (_e.g._, to reduce duplication or focus data generation on
underrepresented areas).
