# Overview

We are building an open access chemical reaction database to support machine
learning and related efforts in reaction prediction, chemical synthesis
planning, and experiment design. Our initial meeting took place on 31 October
2019 and included experts from pharma, academia, and tech.

We expect that this database will be the starting point for the development of
best-in-class tools and models for reaction prediction and synthesis planning.
Additionally, we hope it will serve as a basis for experimental efforts in
industry and academia (_e.g._, to reduce duplication or focus data generation on
underrepresented areas).

This document is designed to provide an overview of the ORD’s scope and goals,
high-level design, technical progress, and plans for access and interfacing.

## Goals

Our overarching goal, stated above, is to "support machine learning and related
efforts in reaction prediction, chemical synthesis planning, and experiment
design".

We aim to:

* Provide a structured data format for chemical reaction data
* Provide an interface for easy browsing and downloading of data
* Make reaction data freely and publicly available for anyone to use
* Encourage sharing of precompetitive proprietary data, especially HTE data

We conducted a
[survey](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1waPzYvDKlb6TAwgsM7bLc7dhZnJ8G-WtVxJSlMhiVK0/edit#gid=585233854)
in late 2019/early 2020 to help define the scope and use cases. With the help of
172 respondents, 93.5% of whom reported having a chemistry background and 20.8%
a computer science background, we have established our focus on single-step
organic reactions.

We aim to accommodate data relevant to medicinal chemistry, process chemistry,
flow chemistry, photochemistry, and electrochemistry. Time-course data,
unstructured analytical data, and metadata about how the reaction was performed
will also be accepted. Reactive molecular dynamics simulations, gas-phase
reaction kinetics, and electronic structure calculations for molecular
featurization are being left for other initiatives.

Additionally, we want to be clear that since the database is in active
development, some features not considered "must-haves" for the initial
deployment may not be supported immediately. We welcome feedback about features
that make or break your excitement in and use of the database.

## Non-goals

Our non-goals for this initiative, at least right now, are to:

* Capture structured data in a manner designed for programmatic execution 
  on automated synthesis hardware (_i.e._, treating reactions as action 
  sequences)
* Store processed analytical data (_e.g._, NMR peak assignments) other than 
  summary statistics (_e.g._, conversion, yield, purity, selectivity); note 
  that unprocessed data (_e.g._, an exported LCMS file) will be stored
* Integrate model building or external datasets as part of the database

There are some practical consequences of these non-goals:

* Because we are structuring reactions as single-step reactions, there are 
  some  more complex operations that cannot be captured in a structured 
  format by the schema. For example, 
  [this OrgSyn example](http://orgsyn.org/demo.aspx?prep=v95p0080) describes a 
  procedure whereby three components are mixed in a chilled vessel on an ice 
  bath, a fourth component is added and stirred for several minutes still on 
  ice, and then the vessel is removed from the ice bath and allowed to warm
  up to room temperature over several hours. This temperature ramp will be 
  captured in a free text field, but the structured temperature field must 
  record either zero Celsius or room temperature.
* Analytical data will not be in a unified format and would be difficult to 
  learn from directly. This might represent a missed opportunity to train, 
  _e.g._, structural elucidation models that predict a molecular structure 
  on the basis of spectral data. Users will still be encouraged to record 
  processed data in a text format. Unprocessed data will be stored in its 
  original file format as exported by analytical instruments.
* Automated synthesis efforts will require additional future work or a 
  separate database, which could lead to fragmentation in the community. 
  However, we expect that the reaction procedure captured in the ORD will be 
  able to be converted to action sequences through simple translation 
  scripts.
  
## Interface

### GitHub

_Coming soon!_

### BigQuery

_Coming soon!_
  
## Getting the data

Anyone can download their own copy of the data and associated code (with or
without a GitHub account). We expect and encourage researchers to download
copies of the entire repository. Snapshots of the repository will be backed up
to [Figshare](https://figshare.com/) at regular intervals. Anyone with a GitHub
account can submit data or code to the database.

Although we have defined the schema using Protocol Buffers, each reaction can be
defined in a human-readable JSON or pbtxt format. The GitHub repository
containing the official version of the database may use the proto binary format
for storage efficiency and speed. Archived snapshots of the repository will
convert examples to a human-readable format so that the data are more
immediately accessible.

### GitHub

The official Open Reaction Database repository is located at 
_Coming soon!_

```eval_rst
.. NOTE::
   We use `Git LFS <https://git-lfs.github.com/>`_ for storing large files such
   as images and raw analytical data. If you want to access these files locally,
   you'll need to install Git LFS before cloning the repository.
```

If you are planning to make submissions to the database, you should start by
[creating a fork](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
of the ORD repository on GitHub. Otherwise, you can simply
[clone](https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
the repository directly.

You may also want to use `--depth` to create a 
[shallow clone](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-clone#Documentation/git-clone.txt---depthltdepthgt)
instead of fetching the entire history of the repository:

```shell
$ git clone --depth=1 "https://github.com/${GITHUB_USERNAME}/${REPOSITORY}"
```

After cloning your fork, set the `upstream` remote to track the official
database repository:

```shell
$ cd "${REPOSITORY}"
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Open-Reaction-Database/ord-submissions-test.git
```

## Submitting to the database

Submissions to the ORD will be handled primarily via GitHub, as [pull
requests](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
to a public repository governed by the CC-BY-SA license (see
[below](#commitment-to-open-access)). All data merged into the official
repository (under the
[Open-Reaction-Database](https://github.com/Open-Reaction-Database) GitHub
organization) will then be hosted on GitHub under this license.

The submission workflow is described in detail [here](submissions.md).

## Leadership
  
### Governing Committee

The ORD is governed by a Governing Committee with representatives from many
industrial and academic institutions. This committee reviews all aspects of the
database, from the underlying structured data representation to the public
interface(s) to promotion and publicity. The current membership of the governing
committee is:

* Connor Coley (MIT)
* Abby Doyle (Princeton)
* Spencer Dreher (Merck)
* Joel Hawkins (Pfizer)
* Klavs Jensen (MIT)
* Steven Kearnes (Google)

### Advisory Board

We are also in the process of forming an Advisory Board to include
representatives from many institutions and industry segments. The primary role
of the Advisory Board is to encourage community engagement with the database.
This may take several forms; for instance:

* Raise awareness of the database by publicizing it to their
  institution/network.
* Encourage use of the database schema when generating or analyzing data.
* Encourage use of the database for machine learning and other data science 
  efforts (including broader use cases like retrosynthetic planning and 
  reaction discovery).
* Provide feedback on the value of the database and areas of improvement for
  the schema or user experience (submission workflow, database browsing and 
  searching, etc.).
* Suggest individuals with strong technical skills and background knowledge
  who may be able to contribute to the implementation and support of 
  database infrastructure, such as web front-ends that will improve the user 
  experience.
* Where possible, guide experimental efforts to address specific needs; for 
  example, by identifying areas of reaction space that are sparsely covered 
  and focusing experimental effort on these areas.

There are no specific requirements for time or resource commitments to be part
of the Advisory Board, nor will any compensation be provided to members of the
board.

## Commitment to Open Access

As the name of the initiative suggests, this will be an open database in every
sense of the word. All data and code associated with the database will be made
publicly available under commonly used licenses that protect open access.

When proprietary tools are used (see [Interfaces and tools](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1snHPGzKMx19IFq4cj7_OMbvhk4WyYHWENxRhj6FxQrQ/edit#heading=h.46xos12p8y6a)),
they will only be used to provide "extra" functionality that is not part of the
core data or the code responsible for data validation and processing. This extra
functionality will be made publicly accessible on the web for anyone to access.

The database is purposely designed to avoid the control or influence of a single
institution. This also ensures that the core data and functionality of the
database will not be affected by any contributor choosing to cease their
involvement in the initiative.

All data submitted to the database will be made available under the
[CC-BY-SA](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/) license, a
well-known license for creative works. Additionally, the various software tools
developed for the database will be made available under the
[Apache](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/apache-2.0/) license; this is
another well-known and OSI-approved license that is used by many organizations
around the world.

## How to help

Additional technical help will also be required to aid in tasks such as
processing submissions and implementing the various tools and interfaces to
improve the user experience. We welcome any donation of time to improve using
the schema, technical infrastructure, front-end work, etc.; or simply to provide
feedback on the user experience.
