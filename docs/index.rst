######################################
Welcome to the Open Reaction Database!
######################################

We are building an open access chemical reaction database to support machine
learning and related efforts in reaction prediction, chemical synthesis
planning, and experiment design. Our initial meeting took place on 31 October
2019 and included experts from pharma, academia, and tech.

We expect that this database will be the starting point for the development of
best-in-class tools and models for reaction prediction and synthesis planning.
Additionally, we hope it will serve as a basis for experimental efforts in
industry and academia (e.g., to reduce duplication or focus data generation on
underrepresented areas).
