 * Throughout this schema, we introduce enums to encourage consistency in

 * not wish to restrict what users are able to specify if their synthesis
 * does not fit cleanly into a pre-existing enum field. For that reason, many
 * enums contain a CUSTOM field, which must be accompanied by setting the
 * 'details' field (or '<field_name>_details', where appropriate).
 *
 * NOTE(kearnes): In many places, we deliberately violate the style guide for
 * enums by nesting instead of prefixing; this is not done lightly. The primary
 * consideration is API consistency and the ability to use unqualified strings
 * as enum values. For instance, we want 'CUSTOM' to be a valid value for all
 * enums that support custom types.
