"""Query web interface to the Open Reaction Database in Postgres.

The client is stateless. Full information is in the URL so results can be
linked.

There are three kinds of query.

  inputs and output SMILES or SMARTS

    These match against individual reagents and results. Each SMILES expression
    can be freely specified for "exact", "substructure", or "similarity"
    matching. SMARTS expressions do not allow such a specification.

  reaction ID

    Matches either zero or one reactions. The ID has the form,
      "ord-<32-bit hex>".

  reaction SMILES

    Matches against RDKit fingerprints.

Query parameters are communicated in URL GET params.

  input=<pattern;(exact|substructure|similarity|smarts)>

  output=<pattern;(exact|substructure|similarity|smarts)>

    The token after the semicolon specifies the matching criterion. The default
    is "exact". The pattern is a SMILES string, unless the token is "smarts" in
    which case the pattern is a SMARTS string.

    The "input" param may be repeated. The "output" param may not.

  reaction_id=<id>

  reaction_smiles=<smiles>

If multiple conditions are given, then the query is interpreted as conjunction.

All query parameters are assumed to be URL-encoded.
